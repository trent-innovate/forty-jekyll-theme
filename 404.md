Error 404

Sorry, we couldn't locate the page you're trying to find. 
Maybe try going back to the         {% for page in site.pages %}{% if page.layout == "home" %}<a href="{{ "" | absolute_url }}">homepage</a>{% endif %}{%endfor %}?

```ruby
# A simple example program in Ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```javascript
// A similar program as above, recreated in ES6 Javascript
function printHi(name) {
  console.log(`Hi, ${name}`)
}
printHi('Tom')
// Prints 'Hi, Tom' to the Development Console
```
