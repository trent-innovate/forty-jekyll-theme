- We have to find people where they are, and get them to where we want them to be
  - The Sales Pitch
    - What is Innovate Trent?
    - How would it benefit me?
    - How can I be a part of what you're doing?

- Get them on our Discord; get them in our meetings (our end goal)

- Create a solid foundation (be able to tell people who don't know us what we're doing and all about)
  - Tried to do stuff last year, but we didn't have a foundation yet

- We need people working on things (labour is our best resource at this point)
  - Bridging some gaps between us and investors is our next goal
  - Funnelling people to Innovation Cluster could be a great goal (Innovate Trent => Innovation Cluster)

- We need to make this fun
  - Incentives for member retention (piece-by-piece incentives, not just a big picture at the end)

- The idea of teams (competition teams)
  - Competition teams will be similar to houses in Harry Potter or armies in Ender's Game
  - What we want to do is get people to join a team
  - Every team will be a separate unit
  - These teams will compete in different events (first one is "sell this pen")
    - Two weeks to create the most-ridiculous marketing campaign for a stupid pen
    - Doesn't have to be a video (can be a skit, music, etc. - everybody can be a part of it)

- We also need specialized teams
  - Marketing team
    - For us (to get more people in Innovate Trent)
    - For people that don't have many skills in marketing to be able to come to us for that
  - Web development teams
    - For people that don't have experience with that but would like websites regardless
  - People can join one of these if they would like
  - Smaller-size teams

- We want to always have a plan, something we can always be working on

- Gameifying the process
  - Badges (displayed on the team section of our website, possibly)
  - Obtaining prestige
  - Perhaps the teams with the most badges get first "dibs" when someone new has a project they want done
  - Maybe convert to "points" where teams could auction them off to get contracts
  - Perhaps take the gameification a bit further (book Wenjack, turn it into some sort of a showcase of the best ideas)

- Voting system
  - Teams can't vote for their own team's projects
  - Live vote in Wenjack at the end of the year (maybe with iClickers or something like that but open-source)

- TYES Pitch Competition could "tye" into (quite literally) our projects

- Sell this pen teams
  - Red
  - Green
  - Blue
  - Within two weeks it'd be nice to get the branding for the teams down pat
  - Random teams would be nice, but it is essential that the teams be *balanced* since competitions could be on many different disciplines
  - Not too big, but big enough to have some team spirit
  - Having a larger, more diverse team is a bonus
  - **These teams could be smaller sub-groups of particular knowledge and expertise inside them**

- Once the teams are up and running, teams can be self-selected (once we know who everyone is)
  - Being able to make that choice enriches the experience, and also works as an incentive *(when people join my team, I feel good)*

- The last thing people want to do is not know what they're doing
  - Eliminate the points of confusion, make the early decisions for them
  - Often, if people are indecisive, they will give up/not make a decision
  - Choice can be given afterwards, once everyone knows what's up

- Possibly set up informal meetings (10-12 Fridays bi-weekly this semester is just for official meetings)
  - Minutes will be taken from the formal meeting, but any team can schedule their own meetings whenever
  - Make private sub-channels/roles on Discord for teams to communicate on their own
  - For now, we're working with what we have

- We are sorta the yang to TYES' ying
  - They are more established/have more connections
  - We are more of the applied/practical side of things; they are more of the instructional/learning/theoretical side of things

- Inter-team meetings are important
  - Having specialized sub-teams meet together (like marketing/web-dev/business, etc) would be ideal

- Innovate Trent is two-focused
  - Devlopment Side: Personal development, skills/experience/networking/ideas
  - Fun Side: Projects, working together on things

- The ideas you get from Innovate Trent can 

- It would be cool to have each team have its own mini-website off ours

- Specialization (a bit later)
  - Innovate Channels (any student/group/club - even if they aren't part of Innovate Trent - can create their own showcase on our website); we'll help you set it up
  - Kinda like a Craiglist but for Trent

- Workshops/projects just for the subgroup (website dev, marketing)
  - **Very easily can open up these up to everyone else**
  - Possibly run a couple sessions twice (one for internal, one for everybody else)
  - Great for marketing our club
  - Workshops could potentially start ASAP, channels could come right after but the people who want to be involved in the channels could be involved right now

- Network with EC Hacks (we could be a practice for that)

- If we *plan* this out well, we can grow
  - We already have some expertise
  - We need a solid gameplan going forward

- Work more on our Discord server (make more channels, make it look more official, etc.)
  - Make a promo channel

- Perhaps we could postpone the "Sell this Pen" event until everybody's ready (keep planning in the mean time)

- We could have multi-disciplinary, simultaneous events/competitions

- The real challenge will be to get people from other discplines involved

- How to get the environmental science students
  - Make and tune a mandate (we have a first draft right now, but we need to have an elevator pitch - 15-30 seconds to get all the information - "*big hook with a lot of bait*")
  - Do it in *as few words as possible*
  - Make the mandate broad enough; get someone who can speak the language of the people we want to attract
  - Make the mandate *vanilla* - applicable to **anybody**

- International Project Management Day (Project Management Paper Competition) and similar oppurtunities exist
  - Find a project that's failed; make a paper on why it failed
  - If we broaden the base, we have a much greater chance of being able to take advantage of one of these

- Kanboard

- Have some sort of challenge to each get one person to come out to the next meeting
  - Bring people to the website/Discord first

- Have a list of people like mentors/advisors that we can call upon
  - Get departmental connections later on
  - Do an experiment with environmental science right now
  - Make an arrangement with every department/club to *take the road-show out* to different departments
  - On our website, show our connections to different organizations
  - Maybe get the chancillor on board
  - Get introduced to people from the Innovation Cluster

- Get keywords (skills development, networking, real-world applications and chances for learning in real life)
  - Take those keywords and string them together in a customized way 
  - "Always be closing" - Alec Baldwin
  - Get more people in here so we can practice our pitches

- TYES pitch competitions
  - Work with them and the teams working on pitches
  - They have week-long challenges
  - They have the "Great Canadian Sales Competition" as one of their sponsors
