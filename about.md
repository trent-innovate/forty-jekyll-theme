    <p>Innovate Trent is a group of students at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. We are dedicated to promoting and fostering new and exciting ideas that our fellow students may have. We're setting things up around here, and hope to have a big launch at Trent's Clubs and Groups Day on <strong>Wednesday, September 11, 2019</strong> on the Bata Library podium.</p>
